## What is the DOM?

DOM stands for "Document Object Model". The DOM is (usually) an HTML document that determines what elements make up a webpage. Each element in the DOM is called a "node". Nodes may be nested inside each other, creating relationships much like a family tree.

### Node Relationships

The node may contain many nodes within itself; those are its "children" or "child nodes", and it may be contained within another node, its "parent node". A node can only be contained within one element, so each node can only have one parent, but may have many children. Nodes contained within the same parent, but not within each other, are considered "siblings". Like children, each node may have many siblings.
