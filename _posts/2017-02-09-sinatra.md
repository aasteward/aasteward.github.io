## Sinatra Introduction

Sinatra is a light Ruby framework for building quick and simple web apps. Sinatra allows you to build up your app's file structure from scratch, like a stripped-down Ruby on Rails. Learning the basics of a simple do-it-yourself style framework can help you understand how all the different parts of a web application work together when you move on to more robust frameworks like Rails.

### Starting Off

Firstly, to run an app with Sinatra, you need to install it into our development environment. In the terminal, assuming you already have Ruby installed, simply type `gem install sinatra` and you should be good to go in just a couple minutes. Now, to start building a web app. Create a file and give it a .rb suffix like any other regular Ruby file; I like to use 'main.rb' but you could name it 'hello.rb' or 'barnacles.rb' or 'rhuba.rb' if you're feeling clever. At the top of this file add an instruction to use Sinatra when this file is executed:

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'sinatra'
{% endhighlight %}

Add a quick bit of code, like a simple 'hello world' script:

{% highlight ruby %}
get '/' do
	"Hello World!"
end
{% endhighlight %}

Now, in your terminal run `ruby main.rb`, or whatever you chose to name your file. You terminal won't output the result of your script and is running a process. How do we know if it worked? Sinatra is hosting the process locally on your machine, you just need to open a browser window. Sinatra by default will run on port 4567, so in the address bar enter `http://localhost/4567/` and you'll see the result of your first Sinatra app. But what's going on here?

### Paths and Views

Let's look back at that code we put in main.rb for a second to understand what it all means. Internet browsers work by sending a request, in the form of a URL, to a server and processing the result for a user in the window. The first line of code is sending a request to the "server" running locally on your machine.

{% highlight ruby %}
get '/' do
{% endhighlight %}

The "/" character notates the root directory for the current domain. Since this is a Sinatra application, the domain is "http://hocalhost/4567" and the following code is the response the Sinatra app is sending to the browser, in this case a simple text display. We can add more paths to our main.rb, and in turn create new and unique responses for each. For example:

{% highlight ruby %}
get '/foo' do
	"bar"
end

get '/bye' do
	"Leaving so soon?"
end
{% endhighlight %}

We've added two new paths to our Sinatra app. Entering `http://localhost/4567/foo` or `http://localhost/4567/bye` will return the corresponding response, but what if we want something a little more complex? It's time to add some views. In the same directory as our main.rb file, let's make a folder called "views". In this folder we can make a file named "goodbye.erb" containing a generic HTML head block and the following code:

{% highlight ruby %}
<p>Leaving so soon?</p>
{% endhighlight %}

Now, in our controller file, main.rb, let's change the response of '/bye' to this:

{% highlight ruby %}
erb :goodbye
{% endhighlight %}

Going back to the browser and visiting `http://localhost/4567/bye` we see exactly the same result, but now there's much more interesting things going on behind the scenes. The instructions for this URL request now generate HTML code from a view file we specified, specifically "goodbye.erb". Using these views, you can now build an entire HTML page and call it with a simple instruction in response to a request from the browser. These requests can be used in hyperlink anchors to allow you to switch between pages in your Sinatra app without typing in a specific address into your browser, or as hyperlink references attached to buttons or icons in your views files, building up a basic website with multiple pages.
