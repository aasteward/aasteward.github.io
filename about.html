	<h2 class="page-title">About</h2>

	<p>Hello! I began web development in early 2017 to be part of an industry that can continue to challenge me to learn and grow, professionally as well as on a personal level. Throughout my life I've been involved in art of all types including writing, theater, music, and fashion. Now, I bring my creative and collaborative skills to the web.</p>

	<p>This website is a simple blog for me to document my growth in the world of web development. Feel free to contact me if you have any comments or questions!</p>
